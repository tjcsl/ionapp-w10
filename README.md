# Setup
Create a config.txt file in the Ion10/Assets folder with the following contents:
```
https://ion.tjhsst.edu
<OAuth client ID>
<OAuth secret>
https://localhost/oauthcallback
```
The first line may be changed to the root url of your own Ion instance if you so wish.

Do not, under any circumstances, add config.txt to the repository, or else jcotton42 will slap you with a clue-by-four.
